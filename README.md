# A Custom KiCAD Library by Eric Boxer

## TL;DR

My personal KiCAD library. Partially because I'm swtiching from EAGLE and needed a way to learn, partially because I like having a little control over my libraries.

## How to use

### Git Submodule (Preferred)

I was inspired by a video I saw by [Sayanee Basu][basu-youtube] about using git submodules as a way to use my library without globalizing it on each machine I use. 

It also has the added benefit of freezing the library in time so if any adjustments are made you know your project will still be fine.

see the video here: [![KiCAD Submodule Library][kicad-submodule-screenshot]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXzJFrLo77Y 'KiCAD Submodule Library')


### Copying into your project

Copy the library to your and link everything. I'll do a more formal writeup at some point...
## Making New Parts and Footprints

All symbols and footprints are my own work for now. About 50% of the 3D models are mine and the rest have been sourced from around the web.

While the majority of the parts in here do have a similar feel there are slight variations as I've been learning to use the tools as well as deciding what really works well AND looks pleasing. I am currently working on a style guide loosley based off of KiCADs own library standard. It can be found [here][kicad-boxlib-style-guide].
